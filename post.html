            In computer science, <strong>Big O Notation</strong> is a mathematical format to express the computational complexity of
            an algorithm. This allows us to determine the <em>time</em> and <em>space</em> that an algorithm will need as its input changes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This article will cover how the Big O Notation works, including some examples in Python: a single <code>for</code> loop,
            a nested <code>for</code> loop, and the built-in <code>map</code> iterator. We will also calculate the time complexity of
            the <strong>Minimax Algorithm</strong>, which can be used in many backtracking problems (such as Tic Tac Toe). At the end, there is 
            a bonus section that mathematically explains how many game states are possible on a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board.

        <h2>Big O Notation</h2>
        <p>
            In Big O Notation, a mathematical function is used to describe the behavior of an algorithm as its input 
            size approaches infinity.
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            f(x) = O(g(x)) as x → ∞
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the following graph, where <var>n</var> is the size of the input.
        </p>
        <canvas id="bigOGraph" style="width:100%;max-width:600px"></canvas>
        <p>
            If a function does not change the number of operations it performs regardless of input, then the time complexity can 
            be described as <var>O(1)</var>, where the complexity is constant. If the number of operations is directly proportional to the 
            input value <var>n</var>, the time complexity is described as <var>O(n)</var>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            An algorithm's complexity can mathematically be any function, such as <var>f(n) = 6n<sup>2</sup>+4n</var>. However, in common
            practice, Big O Notation is often the <em>upper bound</em> of an algorithm's complexity. This is because as the input size grows,
            the <var>n<sup>2</sup></var> becomes the dominant multiplier, and all other terms will become arbitrary. Therefore, if the 
            time complexity of an algorithm is <var>f(n) = 6n<sup>2</sup>+4n</var>, that can be  simplified to <var>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</var>.

        <h2>Big O Python Examples</h2>
        <h3>Singular <code>for</code> Loop</h3>
        <p>
            Consider the below example. This function, <code>addup</code>, takes in <code>num</code> as its only function parameter. It 
            goes on to a <code>for</code> loop, which goes around <code>num</code> times and sums the number of times it has looped.
        </p>
        <pre><code>def addup(num):
        sum = 0
        for i in range(num):
            sum +=1
        return sum</code></pre>
