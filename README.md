# Project Overview
This project is an article in HTML/CSS titled "Big O Notation & Minimax in Python". It 
covers what Big O Notation is and some simple calculation examples in Python. It then
discusses the Minimax Algorithm, including the number of possible game states (nodes) 
in the tree that it builds recursively, as well as the time complexity of the algorithm
itself.
